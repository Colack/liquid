This is a temporary readme file. It will be replaced with a more detailed readme file in the future.

This is Liquid, the engine used in CubeDood 2. (Even though it is a unreleased game.) This is a Java
port of the original Liquid engine, which was written in JavaScript. The original Liquid engine was
slated to be made open source once CubeDood 2 was released, but since CubeDood 2 is no longer being
developed, I decided to make the engine open source now.

I will be translating and updating the original Liquid documentation and putting it in the docs. I
will also be working on making the engine more modular and easier to use. 

You will need to have Java 8 installed to use Liquid. You can download Java 8 from Oracle's website
here: https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html

You can download the latest release of Liquid from the releases page here:
